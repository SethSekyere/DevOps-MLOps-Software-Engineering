**OVERVIEW**

------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains Terraform code to deploy a robust, scalable, and secure three-tier architecture on AWS. The infrastructure is designed to support modern web applications, ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and seamless scalability. The architecture is divided into three layers: Web, Application, and Database, each deployed in a multi-AZ (Availability Zone) setup for resilience.



**#Prerequisites#**


Before deploying this infrastructure, ensure you have the following:

1.) AWS Account: An active AWS account with sufficient permissions to create VPCs, EC2 instances, RDS, and other resources.

2.) Terraform Installed: Terraform CLI installed on your local machine or CI/CD environment. Download it from here (https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

3.) AWS CLI: Configured with your AWS credentials. Run aws configure to set up your credentials.

4.) Git: Installed for version control and cloning this repository.

Future Enhancements
---------------------------


1.) CI/CD Integration: Integrate with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.

2.) Monitoring and Logging: Add CloudWatch alarms, Prometheus, and Grafana for monitoring and observability.

3.) Kubernetes Integration: Deploy a Kubernetes cluster (EKS) for containerized workloads.

4.) MLOps Pipelines: Integrate with ML frameworks like TensorFlow Extended (TFX) or MLflow for end-to-end machine learning workflows.
