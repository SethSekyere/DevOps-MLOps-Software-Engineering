*OVERVIEW*

------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains Terraform code to deploy a robust, scalable, and secure three-tier architecture on AWS. The infrastructure is designed to support modern web applications, ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and seamless scalability. The architecture is divided into three layers: Web, Application, and Database, each deployed in a multi-AZ (Availability Zone) setup for resilience.
