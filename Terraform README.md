This Terraform-based infrastructure-as-code (IaC) project automates the provisioning of an instance configured as a web server. The instance deploys an Apache-based website from a remote source, ensuring seamless and repeatable infrastructure setup.

Dont use code blindly, tweak the variables(variable.tf) to fit what exactly you want. 
Also tweak the web.sh to fit.

DEPLOY!!! (terraform_deploy.sh)

Ensure you run "chmod +x terraform_deploy.sh"
